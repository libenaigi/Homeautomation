Aim:
To design and simulate a Room Automation System using Cisco Packet Tracer that enables remote monitoring and automatic control of a Fan and Room Lamp based on environmental conditions and motion detection.

Result:

- The Lamp turns ON/OFF automatically based on motion detection.  
- The Fan turns ON/OFF automatically based on temperature changes using the Thermostat  
- The system can be remotely monitored and controlled via a tablet interface.  
- Demonstrates a functional smart home automation system with IoT rules-based control.
